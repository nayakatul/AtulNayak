<h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Atul! ðŸ˜Ž </h2>
</div>

I am a Data professional with 3+ years of experience in developing real-time ETL pipelines, ML models, and interactive dashboards to solve complex business challenges. 

I hold a Master of Science in Engineering Management with a specialization in Data from Northeastern University, Boston. This program integrated technical expertise in Data science, data engineering and MLOps with strategic business knowledge, equipping me to design data solutions that not only meet business needs but also drive innovation.

I am also an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate, which has given me a strong understanding of how different AWS services can be used for data engineering and other purposes. This knowledge helps me design better cloud-based solutions that are efficient and tailored to the specific needs of the project.

I am a strong advocate for leveraging technology to address critical issues, enhance efficiency, and promote collaboration across teams.
